# Incident Reporting

## Overview

Security incidents are important to track so that all parties know the status of a breach and can respond in concert.
Current methods to track incidents are generally paper-based manual processes.
More recent systems are based on a centralized database with some web interface to interact with the record and response tracking.

We propose that this does not work well enough in the scenario where security incidents may affect more than a single entity.
For example, a security breach in the supply chain for a food manufacturer could result in several retail businesses with products on shelf that contain a pathogen.
Current methods of notifying the proper authorities require essentially a phone tree to call all the correct parties, which then react as individuals or local committees.
This system would allow all interested parties (retail, governmental, public) to see the incident as soon as it is reported.
Additions to this system would allow cross-entity sharing of response, so all could know of the on-going reaction to this incident.

## Scenario

MedCo is using large data sets that live in AWS s3 for a research application.  The results of the application should be kept encrypted and moved into the corporate private cloud for storage and later use.  This data will be sold to a large pharmaceutical company.

Loss of integrity for this data is critical to the businessâ€™s IP and should be reported and tracked.  In addition to MedCo needing to verify integrity, the purchasing Pharma company will need to verify their purchase has not been compromised.

It could be possible for an employee or a bad actor to thwart the privacy of this data and wipe record of that event taking place.  In order to ensure compliance, we need some method of tracking and preventing alteration of reported incidents.

Blockchain allows for all parties to verify no incidents were reported, or that the incidents reported were handled correctly, and that no tampering of they system has occurred.

Possible con: latency.  Will incidents need to be known in real time, or is some delay reasonable?

On detection of a security incident, a log entry should be made.

### Example incidents

* VMs detected to be running vulnerable software
* Ssh access to VM running the app
* Breach of encryption key security
* AppDefense identifies a problem

## Install the dependencies

* Docker

## Build the ui and truffle containers

    make

## Build and push containers to a specific docker repository

  BASEREPO=harbor.demo.butterhead.net/tompscanlan make push

## Deploy the contracts

    export PRODUCTION_URL=https://dev@blockchain.local:XXXX@$@mgmt.blockchain.vmware.com/blockchains/XXXX/api/concord/eth
    make run-truffle

Sample output:

``` bash

Save the ID following `IncidentLog:` for use when setting your environment for running the server below.

## Running the UI service

Edit the `env` file to update

* `CLIENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` line to match your IncidentLog id from above
* `CLIENT_URL` to be the url to your blockchain's Ethereum API endpoint
* `CLIENT_USER` and `CLIENT_PASSWORD` to be your credentials at that endpoint

Then run

     make run-ui

### post an incident

    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request POST   --data '{"Reporter":"0xFE00BB37A56282d33680542Ae1CD6763660b5555","Message":"automatic reporting"}' localhost:8080/rest/log

### check it

    curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request GET localhost:8080/rest/log/0

### use the ui

Open a browser to http://localhost:8080/log

## Fast demo run through

    # Edit run-demo.sh
    ./run-demo.sh
